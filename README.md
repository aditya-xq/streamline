# üéµ Streamline Your Media: YouTube to MP3 or MP4 in a Snap!

Welcome to the coolest corner of GitHub, where we take the magic of YouTube and turn it into sweet, sweet MP3 or MP4 files for your listening pleasure. Forget those days of keeping a browser tab open just to listen to your favorite tunes or talks. Download once, and it's yours forever!

## What is This Sorcery? üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

In the beginning, there was chaos. And then came the internet, brimming with endless streams of knowledge, cat videos, and, most importantly, music. But even in this modern Eden, there's a serpent's whisper: "Why can't I keep these divine melodies offline?" Lo! We heard your prayers.

## How to Get Started üèÅ

To get your environment set up and running with the Streamline project, please follow these clear and detailed steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Begin by cloning the repository to your local machine. Open your terminal (or anaconda prompt) and execute the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/aditya-xq/streamline.git
   ```
   This command downloads all the project files to a folder named `streamline` on your computer.

2. **Navigate to the Project Folder**: Once cloning is complete, move into the project directory by running:
   ```
   cd streamline
   ```
   This step is essential as all subsequent commands need to be run from within the project's root directory.

3. **Create a New Anaconda Environment**: Before installing the project dependencies, it's a good practice to create a new Anaconda environment. This helps in managing packages and avoiding conflicts between project requirements. Use the following command to create a new environment named `streamline_env` (you can choose a different name if you prefer):
   ```
   conda create --name streamline_env python=3.12
   ```
   After creation, activate the new environment with:
   ```
   conda activate streamline_env
   ```

4. **Install Project Dependencies**: With your Anaconda environment activated, install the necessary project dependencies by running:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   This command reads the `requirements.txt` file in the project directory and installs all the specified Python packages.

5. **Set Up Your Environment Variables**: The project uses an environment file (`.env`) to manage configuration variables such as your desired download folder. Start by renaming the provided example file:
   ```
   mv .env.example .env
   ```
   Then, open the `.env` file in your favorite text editor and fill in the necessary details. The instructions within the file will guide you on what values are needed.

By following these steps, your project environment should be ready for development or usage, with all dependencies installed within a separate Anaconda environment to maintain a clean workspace.

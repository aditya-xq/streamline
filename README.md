# 🎵 Streamline Your Media: YouTube to MP3 or MP4 in a Snap!

Welcome to the coolest corner of GitHub, where we take the magic of YouTube and turn it into sweet, sweet MP3 or MP4 files for your listening pleasure. Forget those days of keeping a browser tab open just to listen to your favorite tunes or talks. Download once, and it's yours forever!

## What is This Sorcery? 🧙‍♂️

In the beginning, there was chaos. And then came the internet, brimming with endless streams of knowledge, cat videos, and, most importantly, music. But even in this modern Eden, there's a serpent's whisper: "Why can't I keep these divine melodies offline?" Lo! We heard your prayers.

## How to Get Started 🏁

1. **Clone this repository**: `git clone https://github.com/aditya-xq/streamline.git`
2. **Navigate into the folder**: `cd streamline`
3. **Install the necessary potions... ahem, I mean dependencies**: Check out our `requirements.txt` or simply wave your magic wand (or, you know, run `pip install -r requirements.txt`).
4. **Set up your environment**: Rename `.env.example` to `.env` and fill it with your secrets (not really, just your desired download folder).

## Summoning the Converter 📣

To transform that video into an MP3/MP4, follow these mystical steps:

1. **Start the app**: `python app.py` and visit `http://localhost:5000` on your favorite browser.
2. **Enter the YouTube URL**: Paste the video link into the cauldron's... um, the webpage's input field.
3. **Choose the download type**: Audio or Video.
4. **Hit 'Convert & Download'**: And watch the magic unfold. 🔮

## Features 🌟
